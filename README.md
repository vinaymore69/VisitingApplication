## 🚀 **How It Works?**  

### 1️⃣ **User Workflow**  
🔹 User registers/login into the app  
🔹 Submits a **visit request** with purpose, date, and time  
🔹 Receives a **unique visit pass code** upon approval  

### 2️⃣ **Admin Workflow**  
🔹 Reviews all **pending visit requests**  
🔹 Accepts or rejects requests based on criteria  
🔹 Approved requests move to the **Accepted Requests** list  

### 3️⃣ **Watchman (Security) Workflow**  
🔹 Logs in via the **Watchman Portal**  
🔹 Enters the **visitor’s unique code** to validate their entry  
🔹 Marks them as **"Entered"**, preventing duplicate usage
